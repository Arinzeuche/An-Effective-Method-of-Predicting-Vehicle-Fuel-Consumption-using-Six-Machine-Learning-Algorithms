## Introduction
The accurate prediction of fuel consumption is crucial for optimizing vehicle performance, reducing carbon emissions, and informing customer purchase decisions. This study leverages historical data, including factors such as vehicle make and model, engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and cylinder size, to train and predict the models. The machine learning algorithms employed in the study include Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

## Methodology
The study used a publicly available dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing information on vehicle fuel consumption spanning from 2000 to 2022 and has 13 features and 22,556 instances. The dataset was pre-processed, and exploratory data analysis was carried out to identify relevant features for predicting fuel consumption. Feature selection and hyperparameter optimization were also conducted to maximize the model's performance.

## Results
The performance of multiple machine learning algorithms for predicting vehicle fuel consumption was evaluated. The results demonstrated that the Gradient Boosting algorithm outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and predictive power. The study provides valuable insights into the optimal model for predicting vehicle fuel consumption, with significant implications for vehicle design and operation, including reducing fuel costs and minimizing environmental impact.

## Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work
The study suggests avenues for further research and development, emphasizing the potential for machine learning algorithms to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of transportation systems. It also highlights the importance of collecting more comprehensive and diverse data to ensure the robustness and accuracy of fuel consumption prediction models.
